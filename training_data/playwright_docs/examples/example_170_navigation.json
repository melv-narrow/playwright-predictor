  "context": "Modern pages perform numerous activities after the `load` event was fired. They fetch data lazily, populate UI, load expensive resources, scripts and styles after the `load` event was fired. There is no way to tell that the page is `loaded`, it depends on the page, framework, etc. So when can you start interacting with it? | In Playwright you can interact with the page at any moment. It will automatically wait for the target elements to become [actionable](/docs/actionability).",
