The report file name looks like `report-<hash>.zip` or `report-<hash>-<shard_number>.zip` when [sharding](/docs/test-sharding) is used. The hash is an optional value computed from `--grep`, `--grepInverted`, `--project` and file filters passed as command line arguments. The hash guarantees that running Playwright with different command line options will produce different but stable between runs report names. The output file name can be overridden in the configuration file or pass as `'PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_FILE'` environment variable. | playwright.config.ts",
