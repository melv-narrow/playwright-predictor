  "context": "Note that resulting matches are sorted by their distance to the anchor element, so you can use [locator.first()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-first) to pick the closest one. This is only useful if you have something like a list of similar elements, where the closest is obviously the right one. However, using [locator.first()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-first) in other cases most likely won't work as expected - it will not target the element you are searching for, but some other element that happens to be the closest like a random empty `<div>`, or an element that is scrolled out and is not currently visible.",
