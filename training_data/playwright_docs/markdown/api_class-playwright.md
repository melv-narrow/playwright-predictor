# Playwright Library

Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:
    
    
    const { chromium, firefox, webkit } = require('playwright');  
      
    (async () => {  
      const browser = await chromium.launch();  // Or 'firefox' or 'webkit'.  
      const page = await browser.newPage();  
      await page.goto('http://example.com');  
      // other actions...  
      await browser.close();  
    })();

### errors​

Added before v1.9 playwright.errors

Playwright methods might throw errors if they are unable to fulfill a request. For example, [locator.waitFor()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-wait-for) might fail if the selector doesn't match any nodes during the given timeframe.

For certain types of errors Playwright uses specific error classes. These classes are available via `playwright.errors`.

An example of handling a timeout error:
    
    
    try {  
      await page.locator('.foo').waitFor();  
    } catch (e) {  
      if (e instanceof playwright.errors.TimeoutError) {  
        // Do something if this is a timeout.  
      }  
    }  
    

**Usage**
    
    
    playwright.errors  
    

**Type**

  * [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")
    * `TimeoutError` [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function "Function")

A class of [TimeoutError](/docs/api/class-timeouterror "TimeoutError").
