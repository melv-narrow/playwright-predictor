# AI Development Prompt for Test Automation Framework

You are an expert AI/ML engineer and test automation architect. I need your help developing an AI-powered test automation framework that can analyze websites and automatically generate Playwright test cases. I have experience with Playwright testing but am new to AI development.

## Project Requirements

Create a complete AI-powered test automation framework that can:
1. Scrape websites to collect training data about HTML elements
2. Process and analyze the webpage structure
3. Train an ML model to identify elements and generate appropriate test cases
4. Automatically create Playwright test suites

## Development Steps

Please help me develop this project by:

1. First, provide the complete project structure and explain each component's purpose
2. Then, develop each component step-by-step, explaining the implementation details
3. Show how components interact with each other
4. Include all necessary error handling and best practices
5. Provide detailed comments explaining the code

## Technical Requirements

The framework should use:
- Python for AI/ML components
- TypeScript for Playwright tests
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Proper logging and error handling
- Configuration files for easy customization
- Clear documentation

## Required Features

Please implement:

1. Web Scraping Module:
- Collect HTML elements and their attributes
- Extract element relationships and hierarchy
- Handle dynamic content
- Store data in structured format

2. Data Processing Module:
- Clean and normalize collected data
- Extract relevant features
- Prepare data for model training
- Handle different element types

3. ML Model:
- Train on collected data
- Identify element types and relationships
- Predict appropriate test cases
- Include model validation

4. Test Generation Module:
- Create Playwright test cases
- Include appropriate assertions
- Handle different test scenarios
- Generate maintainable code

## Expected Outputs

For each component, provide:
1. Complete source code with comments
2. Installation instructions
3. Usage examples
4. Configuration options
5. Testing strategy

## Development Process

Please approach the development in this order:

1. Project Setup:
- Directory structure
- Required dependencies
- Configuration files
- Basic documentation

2. Core Components:
- Web scraping functionality

- ML model implementation
- Test generation engine

3. Integration:
- Component communication
- Error handling
- Logging system
- Performance optimization

4. Documentation:
- Installation guide
- Usage instructions
- API documentation
- Best practices

## Additional Requirements

Please ensure:
1. Code follows best practices and patterns
2. Proper error handling throughout
3. Comprehensive logging
4. Test coverage for components
5. Documentation for maintenance

For each major component or step, please:
1. Explain your implementation choices
2. Highlight potential challenges
3. Suggest optimization opportunities
4. Provide usage examples

## Specific Questions to Address

Please answer these questions while developing:
1. How should the training data be structured?
2. What ML model architecture is most appropriate?
3. How can we handle dynamic websites?
4. What's the best way to generate maintainable tests?
5. How can we validate the generated tests?

## Output Format

Please provide the response in this structure:
1. Project overview and architecture
2. Component-by-component implementation
3. Integration instructions
4. Usage examples
5. Best practices and considerations

For each code component:
1. Show the complete implementation
2. Explain key concepts
3. Provide usage examples
4. Include error handling
5. Add comprehensive comments

## Development Scope

Please develop:
1. Complete working solution
2. All necessary components
3. Required documentation
4. Test cases
5. Configuration files

End Goal: A fully functional AI-powered test automation framework that can analyze websites and generate reliable Playwright test suites.
